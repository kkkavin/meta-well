# Behaviors (Sample Pack)

This folder contains small, copy‑pasteable scripts that show how to react to Convai events (speech, transcripts, “ready”) in a modular way.

If you’re integrating the SDK, start with: `Documentation~/SETUP.md`.

## Who should read this

- **Designers / producers** who want to understand what can be driven by AI dialogue (animations, triggers, UI)
- **Engineers** who want a clean way to add “game rules” without forking the SDK

If you want the broader event-system map first, read `Documentation~/WORKING-WITH-EVENTS.md`.

## Why behaviors exist

Convai scenes usually need small bits of glue code:

- “When the NPC starts speaking, play an animation”
- “When the NPC says a keyword, trigger a quest/shop UI”
- “When the backend says the character is ready, kick off a scripted moment”

The SDK supports this using an **interceptor chain**:

- Behaviors are ordered by **Priority** (higher runs first)
- For callbacks that return `bool`, return:
  - `true` to **consume/intercept** the event (stop the chain)
  - `false` to **observe** the event (let others run)

These behavior scripts are one integration path, not the only one:

- use `ConvaiManager.Events` for typed room/session reactions
- use `ConvaiManager.Transcripts` for transcript state/history
- use relay components for no-code UnityEvent wiring
- use behaviors when you want ordered gameplay logic on top of character or player callbacks
- use `ConvaiActionDispatcher` + `IConvaiActionExecutor` when gameplay should follow backend `action-response` batches instead of transcript heuristics

## How to use (Character behaviors)

1. On your NPC GameObject, add:
   - `Convai/Convai Character`
   - `Convai/Character Behavior Dispatcher`
2. Add one or more behavior components (implement `IConvaiCharacterBehavior`).
   - Recommended base class: `ConvaiCharacterBehaviorBase`
3. Set each behavior’s **Priority** field (higher runs earlier).

If you’re unsure this is wired correctly, open the sample scene:

- `Samples/BasicSample/Scenes/Basic Sample.unity` (after importing samples via Package Manager)

## What’s included

### Character behaviors (wired via `CharacterBehaviorDispatcher`)

- `SpeechAnimationBehavior`
  - Sets an Animator bool parameter named `IsSpeaking` on speech start/stop.
- `ShopkeeperBehavior`
  - Looks for commerce keywords in the **final** transcript and calls `agent.SendTrigger(...)`.
  - Because it returns `true` when it fires, it **consumes** that transcript event for lower-priority behaviors.
- `QuestGiverBehavior`
  - On `OnCharacterReady`, sends a `quest.step` trigger (example of a scripted “start” moment).

### Action executors (wired via `ConvaiActionDispatcher`)

- `AnimatorTriggerActionExecutor`
  - Maps backend action names to Animator triggers.
- `TransformMoveToActionExecutor`
  - Resolves the backend action target and snaps a transform to that target.
- `NavMeshMoveToActionExecutor`
  - Drives a NavMeshAgent to the resolved action target.
- `PickUpActionExecutor`
  - Compound action: move to target, play animation, reparent object to attach point.

Tutorial Playground executors live under `Assets/Sample/ThirdPersonController/Scripts` after importing the tutorial scene:

- `TutorialStartFollowingActionExecutor`
  - Starts following the resolved character target.
- `TutorialStopFollowingActionExecutor`
  - Stops following and clears the follow target.
- `TutorialDropHeldObjectActionExecutor`
  - Detaches and places the currently held object.

Built-in executors (no sample import required):

- `LookAtTargetActionExecutor` — rotates a transform toward the resolved target over a configurable duration.
- `UnityEventActionExecutor` — fires a UnityEvent on execution (no-code wiring).

Recommended setup for action-driven scenes:

1. Add `ConvaiActionConfigSource` to same GameObject as `ConvaiCharacter`.
2. Add one or more `ConvaiActionDefinition` entries: set the backend `ActionName`, `TargetRequirement`, and bind the `Executor` field to the component that should run.
3. Fill `objects`, `characters`, and optional initial attention.
4. Click `Validate Action Config` in the Inspector to catch missing executors, duplicate names, target-reference issues, and weak metadata.
5. Add `ConvaiActionDispatcher`. The dispatcher resolves action definitions and calls bound executors automatically.
6. Add `ConvaiActionDebugProbe` while testing. It records received batches, step reports, failure reasons, and batch aborts.

For the complete current action reference, read `Documentation~/ACTIONS.md`. For the step-by-step tutorial, read `Documentation~/ACTIONS-INTEGRATION-TUTORIAL.md`.

### Player-side runtime setup

Scene-level conversation setup now lives on `ConvaiRoomManager`.

- Use `How The Player Talks = Hands Free` for the default smart-turn path.
- Use `How The Player Talks = Push To Talk` to enable the built-in scene keybind flow.
- Use `Room Setup Source = Room Manager Profile Asset` when you want reusable advanced room defaults to drive the scene instead of inline scene defaults.

The supported runtime implementation for push-to-talk is `ConvaiPushToTalkController`, which the manager provisions and drives automatically from the room-manager configuration.

If you are building a custom runtime flow, the advanced low-level control surfaces are still the room connection and audio services:

- `SetSttMuted(bool)`
- `ForceUserStoppedSpeaking()`
- local mic mute controls via `ConvaiManager.Audio.ToggleMicMuted()`

Player-side sample hook in this folder:

- `PlayerSessionStateHandler`
  - Example `ConvaiPlayerInputHandlerBase` implementation that plays an audio cue when the room reaches `Connected`

### Test doubles

The `Test*` scripts are used by edit-mode tests and are not intended for production.

## Common pitfalls / gotchas

- Behaviors must live on the **same GameObject** as the dispatcher and `ConvaiCharacter`.
- Start by returning `false` (observe) until you know you need to intercept.
- `agent.SendTrigger(...)` only helps if your Convai backend/project is set up to respond to that trigger name.
- Many rules should only run on **final** transcripts (interim results can change).
